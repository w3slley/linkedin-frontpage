I started this project today just to keep my front-end abilities sharp and also to learn new things. I thought the linkedin website was really dope and I wanted to create it from scratch.

I implementet partially the top part of the website. To make the top image from dislocationg the container1 class, I hid the scroll bar in the horizontal with overflow-x: hidden.

So far I completed most of the functionalities of the website for desktop. However I still have one container to do, the grid system to fix and the make one of the images to stay still while the width of the page decreases.

Don't forget how to insert videos on html5:

<iframe width="420" height="315"src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/husM7ItmbFU">
</iframe>

1) To fix the problem I was having with the second side image I used left: 20%, which did what I wanted (while decreasing the size of the screen it doesn't stay on top of the left div, just like the linkedin website).

This is how you create a border on mouse hover without dislocating nearby elements:

box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 1px #2977c9;
