I started this project today just to keep my front-end abilities sharp and also to learn new things. I thought the linkedin website was really dope and I wanted to create it from scratch.

I implementet partially the top part of the website. To make the top image from dislocationg the container1 class, I hid the scroll bar in the horizontal with overflow-x: hidden.
